## Ajay Kumar Gautam (24B0967)

## Week Wise progress:

### Week 1
I made my CP template.   
Then I practiced some question based on Array, Binary Search and Data Structures like `map`, `set`, `unordered_map` etc.

### Week 2
In week 2, I mainly studied two topics    
1. Greedy Algorithms
2. Bit manipulations

### Week 3
I skipped week 3 due to some other commitments, But i will do it in the coming time.

### Week 4 (Ongoing)
In this week, i studied Dynamic Programming(DP). Solved problems from CSES Problem set.

### Week 5
I started Graphs from this week, studied some topics like DFS, BFS, Shortest Paths, some algorithm Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm etc.
